# TodoMaster.

This is a php website interacting with a mysql database that allows users to sign in, create, update, delete and view their todos.

## Note.

This project uses a standalone executable file to run tailwindcss.
To work with this project, you can either use nodejs and npm to install tailwindcss or download the executable from the github repo [Github repo for executable file](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases) and copy it to the root of the application. Afterwards run this command --

```bash
./tailwindcss -i ./css/input.css -o ./css/output.css --watch
```

## Database

The table structure for the database is in the todo_list_1 file in the sql directory.
The name of the database is same as the name of the file (todo_list_1).
Remember to set the connection queries i.e dbhost and dbpassword to your own database's configuration.

## Note.

I am a frontend developer whos into react, vue and Next js.
This is the first php project i'll be working on. I'd love your reviews.

Am open to collaborations.
